## Introduction

Advertising is a key component in marketing strategies, but understanding its effectiveness can be challenging. This project aims to analyze a dataset of advertising expenditures and sales to provide insights into the return on investment (ROI) for TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Advertising.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- `TV`: Advertising spend on TV (in thousands of dollars)
- `Radio`: Advertising spend on Radio (in thousands of dollars)
- `Newspaper`: Advertising spend on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
- `Sales`: Sales of the product (in thousands of units)

## Installation

To run the notebook and analyze the data, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Project Structure

- `task5.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and modeling.
- `Advertising.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## Results

The notebook includes various analyses such as:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships.
- Regression models to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
